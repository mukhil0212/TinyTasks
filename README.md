- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - Mobile application framework
- [Expo](https://expo.dev) - Development platform
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) via [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) - Styling

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your mobile device (for testing)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mukhil0212/TinyTasks.git
   cd TinyTasks
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. Run the app:
   - Scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or Camera app (iOS)
   - Press 'i' to open in iOS simulator
   - Press 'a' to open in Android emulator
   - Press 'w' to open in web browser

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
